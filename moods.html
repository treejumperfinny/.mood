      <h2>Let's take a quick assessment?</h2>
      <p>Remind yourself to practice a tiny bit of mindfulness. Reflect upon what you did today and how you feel. If you
        want to skip this, remember that you'd probably spend longer waiting in line for Starbucks or McDonalds.
        Remember you can't live on chikn nuggies alone!</p>
      <h3>Assessment rules:</h3>
      <ol class="quiz-rules">
        <li id="ass-rules">Take a second to contemplate each question.</li>
        <li id="ass-rules">Give yourself a number rating between 1 and 5 for each question.</li>

        <h2>Question 1: How are you feeling today?</h2>
        <p>1 can be the lowest of the low today. That's fine. We all go there sometimes.
        <p>2 is you are okay, but just barely.</p>
        <p>3 is meh. Not good, and not bad.</p>
        <p>4 is pretty darn good! You can keep this up all day. </p>
        <p>5 is you are good vibes all the way.</p>

        <p>1 is you didn't have anything. </p>
        <p>2 is maybe a glass or two. </p>
        <p>3 is almost there, but not quite.</p>
        <p>4 is one more glass and you'll be good for the day.</p>
        <p>5 is you've hydrated well and then some.</p>

        <h2>Question 3: Are you feeling anxious?</h2>
        <p>1 is yes. Everything right now is making you anxious.</p>
        <p>2 is able to have calm thoughts, but you might go right back into being anxious.</p>
        <p>3 is nothing. No anxiety right now, but it can flaired up.</p>
        <p>4 is you are in a good place, but not 100% anxiety free.</p>
        <p>5 is worry free and anxiety free.</p>

        <h2>Question 4: Is there something to be happy about?</h2>
        <p>1 is a big fat no. There's nothing to be happy about today.</p>
        <p>2 is you've smiled at least. A genuine smile for a fleeting moment.</p>
        <p>3 is yeah. You are content and happy, but it can change.</p>
        <p>4 is almost there. Smiles and love can be felt all around if you just look.</p>
        <p>5 is jolly and jovial. Everything is joyous! There are plenty of things to be thankful for!</p>

        <h2>Question 5: How angry have you been?</h2>
        <p>1 is very irritable. Everything seems to make you upset or angry. You've yelled or screamed today.
        <p>2 is mostly annoyed. Not constantly angry, but you can be easily upset. </p>
        <p>3 is neither here nor there. Anger is a fleeting feeling. </p>
        <p>4 is content. You can get mad, but not with out reason. </p>
        <p>5 is very zen. No anger here!</p>

      <p>Remember that this your mood memo. It is a way for you to jot down what you are feeling in this moment. You don't have to think about if it is right or if it is wrong. Feelings are just that. Feelings. The only wrong here is if you leave it blank.</p>

      <p>
        Feelings of fleeting Fridays from February. Sad songs and spring proms.
        Rememeber and reminisce those long gone days that you might miss. Good
        or bad. Mad or glad. Be grateful for the times you had.
